# Final Project - Best Team - Learning Platform

Description:
Learning Platform is a responsive web application developed as the final project for the HTML and CSS Fundamentals for User Interface Design course. Built by a team of 11 participants, this project demonstrates practical application of semantic HTML, responsive design, and modern frontend development practices.

## Key Features
Semantic & Responsive Layout:
The platform implements a semantic structure that adapts to three breakpoints – mobile devices, tablets, and desktops – ensuring an optimal user experience across all devices.

Modern Normalize & Custom Fonts:
It uses modern-normalize to ensure cross-browser consistency and integrates custom fonts for a modern, cohesive design.

Optimized Images:
All images are stored in the src/images folder and are pre-optimized for fast loading, including support for retina displays. This optimization helps achieve high performance scores on PageSpeed Insights.

  Validation & Performance:

All HTML and CSS files pass validation on W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator.
The project scores at least 70% on all metrics on PageSpeed Insights.
The developer console is free from errors.
Organized Code Structure:

Partial HTML files are located in the src/partials folder and are included in index.html using the <load> tag. (For multi-page sites, each HTML file includes its corresponding partials.)
All partial CSS files are stored in src/css and imported into the main stylesheet (src/css/main.css).

## Modern Development Workflow:
The project was built using Vite as the bundler. Collaboration was managed with Git (including branching, merging, and conflict resolution) and Trello for task planning. Optional roles such as Team Lead and Scrum Master were utilized to streamline project management.

## Clean Repository & Deployment:
All working branches, except for main and gh-pages, have been removed to keep the repository clean. The final version of the project is deployed on GitHub Pages.
