we are in the UK, working on a field with water based machines, we need to write a python code which will tel us if the temperature will drop below 3째C for every night Monday to Friday so that we know to empty the machines of water to prevent any small chances of freezing and damaging the machines


-we will use OpenWeatherMap as our API

-we need to check if the temperature overnight will drop below 3째C for every night Monday to Friday 

-the location has to be choosen based on a postcode

-to prevent high usage of memory or resources the code has to run it's checks from 12:00 to 15:00, Monday to Friday, Example:
		Let's say today is Monday. Is 12:00, the code will do it's checks until 15:00 and at 15:00 if it notices that tonight, the temperature will be as low as 3째C, send out a warning. Same thing will be done tomorrow

-after running it's checks, at 15:00 send out a warning if the lowest temp for that night will be 3째C

-check for the lowest temperature 

-the only information needed form the request is the temperature 


 
-this is our starting point:

import requests
import schedule
import time

def check_weather():
    api_key = "XXXXXXXXX"
    post_code = input('Enter postcode: ')

    url = requests.get(f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?zip={post_code}&appid={api_key}&units=metric")
    data = url.json()
